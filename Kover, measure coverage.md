To measuere the code coverage for [[00 Unit Test]] for [[00 Android]] usually use the Jacoco plugin, but there is an alternative calls:
Kover from JetBrains.
https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx-kover

It's pretty same like the Jacoco, but it provides additional functionality, like 
* You can setup the coverage level and the job will fail if the coverage value less then setted
* Potentially, it provides wore clear value, since it's better for Kotlin
