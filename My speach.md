Hey, my name is Anton, I’m an android developer since 2014. For the last three years, I have been working in Epam in the Lead position.  

I focus primarly on Android native platform, and tasks that be close to Android development, such as the CICD practices, automated test applications and etc  

  

I’m good at resolving different tasks, starting from ideas and ending with delivering the feature to Application Stores.

Also, I have an experience with the best practices for developing the applications, such as code review, code checks, test apps and etc.

I have good knowledge of Kotlin, Java, and Android SDK, Also, I’m comfortable with Python, and Bash. 

I’m pretty good at resolving problems with non-concrete requirements. I know that nobody like that case, and I is not an exception, but when I faced with such cases I’ve successfully resolve it. For example, I built the CICD pipelines for the team for our project. 

  

  

 I think the combination of my skills and experience could be a good addition to your team.
